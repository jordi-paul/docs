# How to collaborate


> *Everything takes ***time***, ***money*** and ***monkeys***. You need a lot from any two groups and a little from the third. An increase in any one reduces the requirement for the other two. Change occurs when one of those three change*


**Time**

Download and install OpenPlotter and test and test and test... Report bugs and request new features in [OpenMarine forums](http://forum.openmarine.net/). Spread the word among your friends in ports and forums.

**Money**

This project is financed by [selling related products ](https://shop.openmarine.net/) or by [voluntary contributions](https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=3J8V5AT6M74L4).

**Monkeys**

> *Men wanted for hazardous journey. Low wages, bitter cold, long hours of complete darkness. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in event of success*
>
>-- Ernest Shackleton

## Documentation

If you want to help us maintain this documentation, let us know what your intentions are in [the forum](http://forum.openmarine.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=16) to coordinate. The best way to do this is to fork [this GitHub repository ](https://github.com/openplotter/docs) and push your commits. If you are not familiar with GitHub, do not worry, send us your contributions to [the forum](http://forum.openmarine.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=16).

**Guidelines**

-  We need schematic and concise documentation just for reference. We do not want manuals, tutorials or detailed *How-to's*. That makes people free to generate their detailed manuals, tutorials or videos for newbies in their language. Remember, this is a reference book, not a tutorial. Be brief and concise.

- A picture is worth a thousand words. Use this tool to make screenshots:

```
	sudo apt install gnome-screenshot
```

- English is not our main language and there will be many errors, please help us with this too.
