!!! note "Raspberry Pi or desktop/laptop computer?"

	OpenPlotter is optimized to be used on [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com) computers, but you can also install OpenPlotter on any desktop or laptop computer running Linux Debian or any derivative like Ubuntu, Mint ... Some OpenPlotter apps that are used to manage some sensors connected via GPIO will not be available when installed on desktop and laptop computers. See a list [here](downloading.md#desktop-and-laptop).

If you try to force an installation of OpenPlotter v4 over OpenPlotter v3 (based on Debian 11 Bullseye), your system will become unstable.

You can also install OpenPlotter in any desktop or laptop computer running your favourite Debian derivative distribution. Hovewer, if your computer is not a Raspberry Pi, you will not be able to install some OpenPlotter apps:

- **Common**: Settings - Docs - Signal K installer - OpenCPN installer - Serial - CAN bus - Dashboards - Notifications - IoB - MAIANA AIS Transponder - Xygrib - AvNav installer - SDR VHF

- **Only Raspberry Pi**: Pypilot - I2C Sensors - GPIO

You just need basic knowledge of Linux to install OpenPlotter for desktop and laptop. Download this *OpenPlotter Settings* package: [![Latest version of 'openplotter-settings' @ Cloudsmith](https://api-prd.cloudsmith.io/v1/badges/version/openplotter/openplotter/deb/openplotter-settings/latest/a=all;xc=main;d=debian%252Fbookworm;t=binary/?render=true&show_latest=true)](https://cloudsmith.io/~openplotter/repos/openplotter/packages/detail/deb/openplotter-settings/latest/a=all;xc=main;d=debian%252Fbookworm;t=binary/) and follow the [Desktop and laptop](installing.md#desktop-and-laptop) chapter to install OpenPlotter from scratch.

## OpenPlotter Expert

Pi-gen is the tool used to create the official *Raspberry Pi OS* images. We use a fork of pi-gen to create OpenPlotter images. Use the *openplotter64* branch of our repository to create your own OpenPlotter flavor. You need good knowledge of Linux to create your own OpenPlotter distributions. Follow instructions in [README file](https://github.com/openplotter/pi-gen/tree/openplotter64).
