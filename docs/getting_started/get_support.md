# Get support

Before sending us private messages, please consider using the following support resources because we receive dozens of emails daily that we cannot answer. Our infrastructure is intentionally small, and the more resources we dedicate to supporting you, the less resources we can devote to development.

## OpenMarine forum

If you have problems using OpenPlotter, do not hesitate to ask in the forum because surely someone has already had the same problem: [forum.openmarine.net](https://forum.openmarine.net)

## OpenMarine AI

If you are feeling lazy or do not want to waste hours searching through thousands of forum posts, hundreds of pages of documentation or dozens of videos, let the machines do it for you. It is also a perfect option if you do not speak English as the AI will translate any information into any of the supported languages.

We have trained a *perplexity AI space* with all the information about OpenMarine projects. Ask it any question as if you were talking to a human and you will be amazed at how effective it is. If you do not get the information you want with your first question, you can continue the conversation and rephrase the question based on the answers: [perplexity.ai/collections/openmarine-ai-support](https://www.perplexity.ai/collections/openmarine-ai-support-SslrWnWdSeuxuzUAkxUVMg)
